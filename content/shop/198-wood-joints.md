description: >-
  198 Wood Joints is an inventory. The book gathers many examples, from ordinary
  to rare, of wood joints presented in the form of axonometries. 198 Wood Joints
  is primarily a technical manual designed for woodworkers. But it is also a
  conceptual object that questions the very nature of the inventory in order to
  erode its foundations and undermine its reassuring objectivity. It is this
  collapse that the author describes in the afterword of the book.
