It is because we can only rely on the strength of our friends that we have created AN.

AN takes stock of today’s world. It tracks, within the manifold manifestations of architecture, what is most insane.

Architecture as we know it is disappearing, and architects with it. For some time, we have understood this. The evidence we are presented with is overwhelming and irrevocable, and any blindness to this disappearance has become pathetic. And yet, there are people who fail to see the endless rows of identical buildings, neither good nor bad. There are those who fail to see that nothing is being learned in schools; that software is doing a better job than humans; that critique falls flat and vanishes, and desire is fading. There are also those who continue to think that architecture is part of the solution, instead of realizing that architecture has become part of the problem. These people continue to make useless exhibitions; useless books; useless courses; useless magazines, and obviously useless and time-consuming Instagram accounts. They are the same people who quietly participate in the destruction of our global environment. Time passes both too slowly and too fast, and nothing seems to change. It’s weird, because we all know that everything must change. It is time to try something, or be defeated in all this mess.

Hell no, it won’t be us who are left sad and bitter.

AN is trying something.\
It may be a shot in the dark, but we are steadily taking aim.

We continue to make do in this lousy economy.\
AN is poor and will remain so.\
We won’t ask anyone for money.

AN is global.\
Our friends are everywhere. We will scour every corner of the earth to find the details of the stories we are telling. And if you happen to disagree, we will be here, ready to engage.

AN has understood the new forms of fascism.\
So beware. AN could come and get you.

AN won’t tell you what to do, but we will try to show you what needs to be changed.\
Perhaps, why not, we will suggest some options.

It goes without saying that AN has no gender.

AN is an annually revised project.\
That you can join.

AN is a poem.\
That you should read with a smile.
